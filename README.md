# Welcome to My Page!

My name is Benjamin Tung, and I'm currently a 4th year Electrical Engineering student at Arizona State. Throughout my studies, I've worked on a number of projects, which I've decided to archive here.

Please take a look at any of my repositories, and I'm happy to answer any questions or provide supporting material through email (tbenjam4@asu.edu) or [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-tung-b5165420a/)!

## FPGA/Verilog Projects

One of my favorite concentrations in Electrical Engineering is **digital circuit design**. I love drawing, designing, and testing the solutions that can make up a very complex system to do some very cool tasks.

One of the tasks I programmed an FPGA to do was play Flappy Bird on a VGA screen!

Other tasks I've worked on include making an [alarm-clock](https://github.com/bentung12/alarm-clock) and a [simple-microprocessor](https://github.com/bentung12/simple-microprocessor) on an FPGA! Feel free to go to these repositories for more information on features and to dig into the code.

## Machine Learning Research Project

Throughout the past year, I've also been working on improving the resilience of image recognition models using **in-situ analog computing hardware (SONOS)** under increasing amounts of radiation. The [cross-sim](https://github.com/bentung12/cross-sim/tree/pytorch) repository was developed by Sandia Labs to mimic the performance of analog memristive chips such as the SONOS chip in python. I developed multiple image recognition models using PyTorch and applied multiple training and correction techniques to eventually improve the resilience of the models against radiation by about 10 times!

Take a look at these two folders in the repository for more information about my code and results.
